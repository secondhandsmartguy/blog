Usually I have at least a title. Now I don't. I know vaguely what I want to say, but that's about it. And I don't think I'll make a big intro to this. I'll just say this.

I want to feel sad. I want to cry. I fooled myself into thinking that being happy is the final goal. FUCK. THAT. I want to feel it all. I want the experience of failure to bring me every emotion. Anger, sadness, rock bottom, and then I want to climb out of it. Then I want to feel happy, satisfied and relieved.

If we think that chronic depression is horrible, why don't we think about chronic happiness the same.

I want that heartbreak to hurt. Fuck that whole notion of being happy to see your ex. I want it to feel like a truck hit me. Fuck that idea that once you're not friends with someone it doesn't suck. If it doesn't suck, that friendship was shit. I've only been like that with 2 people, and fuck those guys. You wanna know why I want it to suck so bad? Because I want to be the person who knows that however the relationships end in my life, in the end, I know that I was willing to love that person. I can't say that I love instantly, I don't. But I want to give that benefit of the doubt to the people around me. I want to invite everyone to love them. And I want that love to be so pure, unreasoned, irrational, unexplainable.

One of my favorite songs is by Pearl Jam. It's called "Just breathe". There's this beautiful lyric in it. "I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love". I took it as an insult when people called me emotional before. Now I wear it as a badge of honor. I am. I'm so profusely emotional that sometimes I'm scared of it. It scares me so I build these walls around me. But that lyric always hits me. That's who I want to be. I want to be the lucky man and count on both hands the ones I love. But to achieve that, I only need 6 people. I already have 5. I have a sister, my parents and two of my friends. That's a lot. But I want more. Love is such a great powerful drug and I want that intoxication.

I think that these delusional crazy thoughts I have in my mind make me a very difficult person to be around. I understand that. My intensity is sometimes a big wall to hit. But here's how I see things. Every other friend that I "don't" love, I want to find ways to love them like I love the 5 people I mentioned.

There's a part of me that always hated when someone said "You can't have a lot of people you love in your life". Well fuck you. I'll damn well try. I'd rather miserably fail in giving love than succeed in settling for just a small group.

I realized that every girl I was "in a relationship" with or that I was going to be with but something went wrong, I was ready to love. I didn't love them, but I was ready to love them.Â 

I see people go into relationships to try to be in a relationship. I want to go into relationships because I want to love that person. I'd rather fail in loving someone than fail to be with someone.

Failing to be with someone is easy. Failing to love someone hurts much more. Because if you're willing to love someone, then you expect that person is also willing to try to love you. We're scared of that, but, damn it, I want to be scared. And when it fails, I want to suck. I want to, when I see that girl, I want to hurt the first time, and I want it to hurt every next time, because that means that I was honest.

Maybe I'll get used to the pain, but I never want it to go away, because I want that failure to be there with me, because, I hope, when I meet someone and by the astronomical chances it works, I want to know that I never failed to be ready to love them.

With friends it works a little easier because we take it way less personal. But still, I want everyone else around me, whether we're out together a lot, or we see each other once a year or once every 5 years, or we just text sometimes, I want you who reads this, I want you to know that I'm prepared to love you. I don't know if I will, but I'm ready to try.

Sincerely yours,

Damad Butkovic
