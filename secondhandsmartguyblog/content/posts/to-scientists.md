Hey there, future scientist.

So you want to be a scientist? Help the World. Improve our understanding of the universe, improve the way we live our lives, improve the quality of life, our health?Â 

Good luck! I hope you do. I was never brave enough for that. Because I was never brave enough for that, I became an engineer. A lower class. Engineering is a wonderful thing, but we are just fixing things with tools you, scientists, provide us with. Engineering has its own set of problems, but in my opinion, yours is much worse.

You might be wondering, what is so brave about being a scientist? Here's what.

You're going to be doubted at every step. If you do your job fast, you're going to be blamed for being a part of some conspiracy because you did your job fast and efficiently. If you, however, don't solve a problem, everything your branch of science did will be questioned because you didn't solve that one problem. Even if you do your job perfectly, and you provide the best possible, optimal solution, it's still not good enough. It will never be good enough. Don't expect a pat on the back. Don't expect an award. Don't expect money. There will be no accolade for you. You are going to have to train yourself to be satisfied when you're criticized. And I don't mean when you're NOT. I literally mean that you will have to learn to enjoy being criticized and enjoy it while it's coming from people that are not willing to invest any time to understand anything about the process of your research and invention. It's an ironic thing really. Your evidence will be challenged by religious leaders, pseudoscientists, and people that believe that a sorcerer from 300 years ago had better tools to fix common people's problems than you do. And their ideas will not be questioned with the same intensity. In fact, it won't even be close. Once you fail, because you inevitably will, no scientist is perfect, everything you've worked for, and everything you stood for will not only be challenged, but will be dismissed in favor of the aforementioned religious leaders and pseudoscientists.

Here's one of my favorite parts. Even if you don't do anything that I already said and you don't make mistakes, and you provide evidence that's great, it's still not enough. You are going to be held to an impossibly high standard. People that you'll be arguing with and people whose lives you'll be improving, saving and explaining will question you without even giving you a chance to answer their questions. And even if they give you a chance to explain what you mean, they will take only the parts that fit their narrative and will then use it against you, willfully ignoring everything else you've said and effectively making you seem like an idiot.

I realize how depressing this sounds. But that's the job. The mission, should you choose to accept it. We need you. We always did. We always will. The fact that you don't get the recognition you deserve hurts me whenever I hear someone spitting on the work you do. But, it is what it is. If you've chosen to accept the mission, thank you for your service to humanity.

You think you can live with all of this?

Then Godspeed. A small, unknown engineer, from a little, shithole, country is with you 'till the end of the line.

Your sincerely,

Damad Butkovic
