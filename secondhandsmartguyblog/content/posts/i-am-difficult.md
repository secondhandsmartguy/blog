I'm a very difficult person to be around. Phew. That kinda felt good to admit. No one wants that. Everybody wants to be that easy going, approachable type. Well... I'm not.

I lose interest in conversations extremely fast. I hate small talk. I know everyone says that, but through my "research", I call bullshit. People don't want to talk about anything deeper than what makes them feel superior. I challenge you, just for yourself, stand in front of a mirror, and call out your insecurities. It sucks doing it just for yourself, let alone in front of other people. Having a conversation with me, for a normal, regular person, feels like running a marathon. This isn't my opinion, I've been told that on many occasions.

I can't let loose. I like to listen to music a lot, but if I judge something to be crap, I can't even pretend to enjoy it.

I can't watch random things on TV or youtube. I became so elitist that I can't enjoy easy comedy. It has to be political, dark, hard to understand, or else I see it as easy jokes and I don't laugh. Not because I don't want to, but I literally don't feel like laughing.

I feel sorry for people without ambition. I literally can't be around them. It feels like someone is stabbing a fork in my brain. I wanted to be an engineer, so I became one. I wanted to play many instruments, so I learned them. I wanted to be able to save someone's life, so I learned first aid on a very high level. I wanted to produce music, so I learned that. I wanted to have a studio, so I worked and built one. I wanted to talk about things that bugged my brain, so I started a podcast. I wanted to be useful in the household so I learned how to fix shit and how to cook. Then I wanted to actually admit shit and fix things about my character, so I started a blog where I publically call myself out and hold myself accountable. And there are things I do that aren't ready to be talked about. All in due time, but rest assured that there are more big things coming. I think this is the first time I actually spoke about all of these things. I feel proud of myself and I'm kinda tired of hiding it. But see? This is why I can't stand unambitious people. Because I may have a problem with being too ambitious. Having a conversation with someone without ambition is like volunteering to step on a lego every time they start another sentence.

The way I said this, I think you might be wondering is this something I want to change or something that bothers me? I gotta be honest... I love it. I love being this way. I like that not everyone can be around me. Saves me a lot of time because I don't have to act like I care about the weather, a random gossip, or someone bragging about being good at a job literally a monkey could do.

The reason I'm saying this is because I want to believe anyone can actually have a conversation with me, if only they tried to actually talk, I would learn from them and they would learn from me. Most of the time, people just want to seem smarter than me to themselves. And honestly, I stopped giving a fuck. Feel smarter. Feel superior. Fulfill the void in yourself for a day because you think you're smarter than me. At least I stopped fooling myself that I can pull God by his balls. I don't care about you. I care about being better, so that one day, in spite of being all of this, I can be approachable. Maybe not easy to be around, but I'm gonna start with approachable.

Sincerely yours,

Damad Butkovic
