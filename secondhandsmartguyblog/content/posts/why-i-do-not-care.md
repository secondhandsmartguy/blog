Less than a year ago, I was a militant pro vaxxer. I couldn't even fathom the idea that someone doesn't want to get vaccinated and I had absolutely no sympathy for people that caught COVID and weren't vaccinated.

Do I still think we should get vaccinated? Yes, absolutely. There's more than solid evidence that it works and it's saving lives.

Where I differ from my past self is that I don't think mandates are a good idea. If you try to take away the freedom from people, they resist. Freedom of choice is extremely important, not just in this case, but generally. The only proper way to have people change their mind is to teach them about vaccines and let them draw their own conclusions. I broke this down earlier, science and reasoning will never completely win, so going for that absolute is a waste of time.

My new view is, I think, way more accepting. What I failed to realize is that most people aren't resisting vaccinations because they believe in some grand conspiracy. In most cases, that I know, people are deeply afraid. Who can blame them? Short of maybe a world war, this is by far the worst thing that can happen globally.

I realized that we have actually been aiming for the same goal all this time. I failed to see that before because I was so blinded by my convictions, believing firmly that only my way is the right way. And it was so simple. All along, we were trying to keep our loved ones safe.

Unfortunately for my past self, I didn't realize that it was the only thing that mattered. As I said previously, the best we can do is the best we can do. Convictions and beliefs will always differ but the common idea that will push our society out of this pandemic and many more misfortunes is our compassion for one another. However big my convictions are, and as much evidenceÂ  is out there, that will never help if we try to make people trust it by force.

So if there is a message to get out of my mistakes it's that compassion is the most important tool we have as a society. And the best part is, it's free and readily available. So use it and use it as much as you can.

So that's why I don't care if you're vaccinated or not anymore. I only care for you and I hope you care about me too.

Sincerely yours,
